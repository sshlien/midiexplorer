If you are running version 1.109 or higher and downloaded the clean
MIDI subset from Colin Raffel's site https://colinraffel.com/projects/lmd/
then the playlist folder may be useful. The MIDI files in this collection
are organized into more than 2200 folders where each folder reflects the
artists name. The genre's vary from pop, rock, blues, to jazz. The files
in the playlists folder attempt to organize a few of the artist folders
into genres. These are all plain text files which you can modify using
an editor such as notepad. The records in the file contain the names of
the relevant folders in the clean database. Copy or move the playlists
folder into the folder containing the clean database. Now midiexplorer
allows you to navigate through these playlists using the playlist manager
which is accessible through the File menu item on the top left.

The organization of the artists into genres is not exact and based
on various web sources in particular
http://www.cp.jku.at/people/schedl/music/C1995a_artists_genres.txt
some of the artists produce music in various styles and appear
in more than one file. I may update the organization in the future.

The contents of the platinum_and_gold.txt file is based on the
RIAA list on the web page
https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=awards_by_artist#search_section
The first two hundred artists are listed.

If you have your own midi file collection, you can create a similar
organization by following the same format of the this sample playlists
directory and placing it into the root midi folder of interest.

The information in defintions.txt was gathered from the web with the
help of Google
