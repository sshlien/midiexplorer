<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Midiexplorer is a tool for exploring and analyzing a large collection of
MIDI files. In particular, it was developed for managing the
<b>Clean MIDI subset</b> that can be downloaded from
<a href="https://colinraffel.com/projects/lmd/">https://colinraffel.com/projects/lmd/</a>.
This collection contains approximately 17,000 MIDI files organized
by artist. If you download this collection, then you should also 
get the folder <b>lakh_playlist</b> which links the various music
genres to this collection.
<p>
Midiexplorer contains various visualization tools. It can extract
the characteristics of these files and store them in a
database. This database can be used to search for files having
certain attributes.
<p>
The latest documentation is found on
<a href=https://midiexplorer.sourceforge.io/>https://midiexplorer.sourceforge.io/</a>.
 

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
With one exception (see below),
you will require tcl/tk 8.5 or higher and some other executables
installed on your system. On Linux,
you start midiexplorer by typing
<pre>
wish midiexplorer.tcl
</pre>
On Windows you would double click on the midiexplorer.tcl icon.

<p>
Midiexplorer depends on many external applications. If you
are running runabc, then you probably have these externals.
<p>
It requires a midi player (either commercial
or freeware).  Several players are suggested in the documentation.
<p>
Midiexplorer requires the executables midicopy, midi2abc,
abc2midi which are part of the abcmidi project. The latest source code to
these externals as well as midiexplorer.tcl can be found on

<a href= https://ifdo.ca/~seymour/runabc/top.html>https://ifdo.ca/~seymour/runabc/top.html</a>

The source code can also be found on
 <a href= https://sourceforge.net/projects/abcmidi/>https://sourceforge.net/projects/abcmidi/</a> or 
 <a href=https://github.com/sshlien/abcmidi>https://github.com/sshlien/abcmidi</a> but they are not updated frequently.

<p>
You also require an internet browser in order to use some of the features.

<p>
Binaries for various operating systems can be found on
<a href=http://abcplus.sourceforge.net/>http://abcplus.sourceforge.net/</a>

<p>
If you running on a Windows operating system (Windows 10, 8.1, 8,0, 7, or
XP), then you can install midiexplorer from
<a href=https://sourceforge.net/projects/midiexplorer/>https://sourceforge.net/projects/midiexplorer/</a>. The windows_binary folder contains win32 executables
that allow you to avoid installing Tcl/Tk. You will still need an external midi player.
